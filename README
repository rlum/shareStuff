cs304 project

share stuff web site designed for Linux/Apache/Oracle database/ PHP    (UBC provided systems).
includes sql files for instantiating initial database with test data.

not all files are used. given multiple contributors and time constraints, no one 
had the time to remove old or deprecated html/php files 

Uses html and php, no css.  Not secure, focus was on basic functionality. 
eg.
Passwords in plain text in database, 
only some forms are protected from sql injection. 
flat directory structures with all files rwx
